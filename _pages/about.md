I am a recent graduate from The [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), majoring at Master of Information technology. I am planing to start my career as a software developer focusing on back end development with Java and SpringBoot or Python. Then, I plan to develop my technology stack for a higher-level DevOps engineer or algorithm engineer. 

I also had experience in machine learning. My thesis project was developing both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to identify the intruder with the Texas Instrument millimeter-wave radar.
